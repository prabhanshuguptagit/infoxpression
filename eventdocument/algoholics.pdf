Sample Question

A unit fraction contains one in the numerator. The decimal representation of unit fractions with denominator 2 – 10 are given.

½ = 0.5
1/3 = 0.(3)
¼ = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1
Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d consists of the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

 

Sample Algorithm Question

Write an efficient C program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.

Kadane’s Algorithm:

Initialize:
max_so_far = 0
max_ending_here = 0
Loop for each element of the array
a) max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
b) if(max_ending_here < 0)
max_ending_here = 0
c) if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)
max_so_far = max_ending_here
return max_so_far
